\paragraph{A first Look at the Captured Trace}
    \item Select one UDP packet form your trace.  From this packet, determine how many fields there are in the UDP header.  Name these fields
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item Determine the length in bytes of each of the UDP header fields
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item The value in the length field is the length of what?  Verify your claim with your captured UDP packet
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item What ist he maximum number of bytes that can be included in a UDP payload?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item What ist he largest possible source port number?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item What ist he protocol number for UDP?  Give your answer in both hexadecimal and decimal notation
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 
        \end{itemize}

    \item Examine a pair of UDP packets in which your host sends the first UDP packet and the second UDP packet is a reply to this first UDP packet.  Describe the relationship between
    the port numbers in the two packets.
