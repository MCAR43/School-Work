  \paragraph{HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/response interaction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item\begin{enumerate}
      \item Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET reequest from your browser to the server.  Do you see an "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" line in the HTTP GET?

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes, there was a content length field, and a specified number of bytes indicating the server explicitly downloaded the contents.
        \item \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/HTTP9.png}

        \end{itemize}
      \item What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned form the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? Explain.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The HTTP status code is 304, not modified.
          \item The server returned a cached version of the file, there is no filedata field, and no amount of bytes specified.
          \item \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/HTTP11.png}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item The images were downloaded in parallel because processing of the request can't have finished before the next tcp request is opened, they are milliseconds apart as seen in the image
